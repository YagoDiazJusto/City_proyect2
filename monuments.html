                    is a massive bronze bell housed in a stone

                <p>
                    The Watts Towers, Torres de Simon Rodia, or Nuestro Pueblo are a collection of 17 interconnected
                    towers,
                    architecturally structured, and individual sculptures
                    featuring mosaics on the site where the artist originally resided in Watts, Los Angeles.
                    The entire site of the towers, structures, sculptures, pavement
                    and walls were designed and built by Sabato ("Simon") Rodia, an Italian immigrant and construction
                    worker and tile maker, over a period of 33 years between 1921 to 1954.
                    The height of the towers is 99.5 feet (30.3 m). The towers are an example of outsider art (or Art
                    Brut)
                    and Italian-American naïve art.

                        Greeting visitors upon their arrival at Griffith Observatory, the Astronomers
                        Monument is a large outdoor concrete sculpture on
                        the front lawn that pays homage to six of the greatest astronomers of all time.
                        The monument is an enduring product of the great economic depression of the 1930s,
                        when New Deal initiatives created federally-funded work
                        programs to employ skilled workers at a time when they would otherwise
                        remain idle and without income. One of the first of these programs,
                        the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP), began in December 1933.
