        <h2>On this page we will find content about the toponomy of <strong>Los Angeles</strong></h2>
        <article>
            <p>
            <strong>Los Angeles</strong>, as we already know, belongs to a state of the USA, California.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>California</strong> is the name that Spanish conquerors assigned to an area of ​​America corresponding to the peninsula that today bears that same
            name and to a region located to the north of it. This name comes from an imaginary place mentioned in Las sergas de 
            Esplandián, a novel of chivalry by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo, published in 1510. It is still disputed where 
            exactly the idea of ​​using such a name came from, to what was initially believed to be a island and was called California.

            </p>
            <p>
                The name of <strong>Los Angeles</strong>> derives from Santa Maria degli Angeli ("Holy Mary of the Angels"), the Italian town 
                that houses the Porziuncola, the chapel where the Franciscan movement originated. Friar Crespí, 
                Junípero Serra, and the early California missionaries did indeed belong to the Franciscan Order.
